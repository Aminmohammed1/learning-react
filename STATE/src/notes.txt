How the state update works...
Updating the UI is a 3-phase process:
    -the trigger phase -> this happens the moment useState hook is called..the component is stored in list of components to be re-run.
    -the render phase -> calls the component function again.. and figure out which parts need to be updated.
    -the commit phase -> changes from render phase is taken and applied to commit phase.
